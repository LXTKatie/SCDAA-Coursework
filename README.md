# SCDAA Coursework 2025 – Final Report

This repository contains all the code and outputs required to reproduce the results for the SCDAA coursework 2025. All tasks are implemented and documented within a single Jupyter notebook.

## Repository Contents

- `SCDAA_Report.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code, outputs, plots, and explanations for:
  - Exercise 1.1: Solving strict LQR using Riccati ODE
  - Exercise 1.2: Monte Carlo validation of the analytic value function
  - Exercise 2.1: Solving soft LQR using entropic regularization and comparing trajectories with strict LQR from multiple initial conditions ([2,2], [2,–2], [–2,–2], [–2,2])
  - Exercise 3.1: Critic-only supervised training to approximate soft LQR value function
  - Exercise 4.1: Actor-only training using the known optimal value function to learn the optimal policy.
  - Exercise 5.1: Full actor-critic training jointly updating value and policy networks under the soft LQR formulation.

## Dependencies

You will need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy torch matplotlib scipy
```

The notebook is tested using:
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run

To reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook SCDAA_Report.ipynb
```
3. Click "Run All" to execute every cell in order.


## Notes

All outputs in the final PDF report were directly generated by running this notebook. No external data files are required. Randomness is controlled using `torch.manual_seed` where applicable.
